## PalindromeChecker.js

Function Palindrome returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, returns false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Example 1- palindrome("eye") returns true.

Example 2- palindrome("race car") returns true

Example 3- palindrome("not a palindrome") returns false.

## CeasarsCipher.js

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

The rot13 function decodes a ceasars cipher message.

Example- rot13("SERR CVMMN!") decodes the string FREE PIZZA!
